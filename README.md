This thesis shows how NLP Deep Learning methods, trained on user
interactions sequences at H&M website, can be used to model user
behavior and create personalized recommendations. We performed
multiple experiments to prove how an ordered user history helps the
model learn. Both item and user representations proved themselves
to play an important role in our model’s performance. New models
won at performance but also saw different patterns on recommended
items, recommending less popular items, and more expensive than
our baseline model.

We believe it is the powerful representation learning and the ability
to capture order within sequences that are responsible for the performance improvements. Multiple lines of work have been opened, the
usage of cross market data could increase the learned representations
as well as helping the model generalize. The removal of user identifiers is an interesting work as well, replacing them with user features
instead could remove the cold-start problem and add more information to the model.

The fashion industry presents a new paradigm for recommender
systems, high fast-phased trends and user-brand engagement. Companies in fashion do not only have the objective to recommend items
users will buy, but also promote a trendy-fashion image of themselves
to engage with the user and project the image of leading company
in fashion. Fashion companies compete between themselves to create new trends and increase their customer group, metrics promoting
diversity and better user engagement like the ones presented in this
thesis will help compete in the market.

To sum up, our work has taken the research of companies like Alibaba, Amazon, and Google to the second-biggest worldwide fashion
retailer and proved it useful. We have a new niche were our item’s life
frequency is much lower than theirs, and it is our duty to continue the
work on researching recommender systems capable of learning high
fast-phased trends
